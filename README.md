# foo_playlists_sort
[foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/) component: Sort playlists alphabetically, on demand.



# Why

While using [FooDock](https://github.com/Namek/FooDock/) like this:

![FooDock playlists](https://github.com/Namek/FooDock/blob/master/screenshots/ss1.png?raw=true)

I was having troubles with a long list of playlists. It was hard to look through them and pick the only desired one.

This plugin sorts playlists on demand.
